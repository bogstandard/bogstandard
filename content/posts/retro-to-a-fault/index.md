Continuing to place the viewfinder in the center of mirrorless cameras & continuing to include the weird pentaprism lump feels a bit daft, to me at least. Sure it looks the part (no accounting for taste) but it's an awkward and a redundant hangover from the days when these things were physically required to be centeral on the camera body for the camera to work.

There's no good reason for modern mirrorless cameras to continue to force the user to squish their noses against the back-screen in the age of digital. Rangefinder manufacturers figured this out decades ago; there wasn't a *physical requirement* to have a pentaprism and central VF - so they didn't, and now mirrorless cameras don't *need* to either, so why continue to ape an SLR era compromise? Taste.

I tried to argue this on Threads and got some push back, one comically prevelent counter arguement was that left-dominant eyed people prefer it because right-dominant eyed people also have to endure squishing their noses to use the VF. Misery really loves company. Another major counter was that it is good because status quo is good. Neither very compelling.
