This blog is a scrapbook of poorly conveyed ideas. Here you'll find posts on mostly history, photography, mathematics & fencing. Nothing here is to be taken too seriously.

My favourite code projects are pinned on my [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/bogstandard) but here's a quick rundown on the state of things.


### 🃏[Poqueta](https://poqueta.com) is creating daily puzzle games!
Enjoy a daily poker squares puzzle, generated automatically each morning using a clever bit of math.
Drag and drop six cards correctly within the square to complete the daily **required hands** both vertically and horizontally. Hands must contain five cards.

### ⭐️ [Sphere of Influence](http://sphere-of-influence.github.io) is still mapping Soviet Culture!
Though there's been no recent code changes, the map is still self updating & curating the history and civilian life of the USSR. Meanwhile the [Northpole Beta](https://sphere-of-influence.github.io/#!/northpole) ❄️ showcases just how dynamic the platform can be. 

A fork of Sphere of Influence is under private development to allow the public to easily create their own maps.

### 🌧 [RL-Weather](https://github.com/bogstandard/rl-weather) is raining & snowing on players!
With over [~6,334 active installs](https://runelite.net/plugin-hub/show/rl-weather) this lightweight RuneLite plugin provides crunchy old school weather effects to players of OSRS.

### 🎲 [Dice](https://github.com/bogstandard/dice) is now avaliable on the Plugin-Hub!
This RuneLite plugin adds on-screen animated dynamic dice rolls to bring a table-top experience to the OSRS game world.

### 🌲 [Lapland Golf Club](https://bogstandard.github.io/lapland-golf-club/) is over!
An open scoring system to complement [Eric Wastl's](https://github.com/topaz) annual [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com). Code golf your solutions and track your running average. Lapland Golf Club allows play alongside friends in any language from any repo and self updates (almost) automatically! The club has closed for the season, see you next year!
