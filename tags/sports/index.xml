      <description>&lt;p&gt;Everything written in this article is done using George Silver&amp;rsquo;s Brief Instructions as the single source, with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/brief.html&#34;&gt;Greg Lindahl&amp;rsquo;s transcription&lt;/a&gt; used for understandable quotes, but you can view a copy of the text that&amp;rsquo;s nearer to the original on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.org/details/worksgeorgesilv00mattgoog/page/n183/mode/2up&#34;&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt; if you enjoy squinting and headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m deliberately ignoring the original Paradoxes of Defense here, it&amp;rsquo;s a chore to read, and an angry embarrassing mess. Like Marcion rejecting the Old Testament, followers of Silver should be lauding the clear, rules-based methodology of the later Brief Instructions and shunning of the polemic Paradoxes of Defense.  Brief Instructions existing at all hints that even Silver understood his original work was pretty awful and his later adoption of manualistic style hints that he knew also the original was rubbish for teaching anything.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Supposed Notation/Shorthand for Fencing Plays</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is not as far as I’m aware a common, system agnostic, simple textual notation for fencing; moves that can be written without advanced ligatures or illustrations. There’s a pretty extensive history of written notation for dance, which in terms of motion is fairly close to fencing, but none besides &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labanotation&#34;&gt;Labanotation&lt;/a&gt; (which is used by the US for the copyright of dance) have significantly caught on and endured in history. Dance/Movement notation is a relatively niche field and jam-packed with advanced symbols and flexible geometry. Without resorting to clunky spoken language, it’s tough to describe a sequence of bodily movements quickly, casually and succinctly in non-graphical form.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
