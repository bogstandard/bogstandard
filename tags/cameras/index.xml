      <title>Ode to Dubious Lenses: &#34;HD MC 162728&#34;</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got roughly ten or so lenses in my collection, most are second-hand manual lenses of varying prestige, quality, and cost. I dislike my official Fujis the most, they are totems of wasted money and frustration (&amp;ldquo;Maybe this time I&amp;rsquo;ll get along with the autofocus!&amp;rdquo;). My old Soviet &amp;amp; East German lenses are &lt;em&gt;okay&lt;/em&gt;, but I find myself playing pretend that they&amp;rsquo;re good and worth keeping going with (there&amp;rsquo;s a political joke somewhere there), they are just so cumbersome to use casually and using a mount adapter is always shit. Soviet lenses have not aged well, despite my misguided affection for that mess of history.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Continuing to place the viewfinder in the center of mirrorless cameras &amp;amp; continuing to include the weird pentaprism lump feels a bit daft, to me at least. Sure it looks the part (no accounting for taste) but it&amp;rsquo;s an awkward and a redundant hangover from the days when these things were physically required to be centeral on the camera body for the camera to work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no good reason for modern mirrorless cameras to continue to force the user to squish their noses against the back-screen in the age of digital. Rangefinder manufacturers figured this out decades ago; there wasn&amp;rsquo;t a &lt;em&gt;physical requirement&lt;/em&gt; to have a pentaprism and central VF - so they didn&amp;rsquo;t, and now mirrorless cameras don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to either, so why continue to ape an SLR era compromise? Taste.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
