      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is not as far as I’m aware a common, system agnostic, simple textual notation for fencing; moves that can be written without advanced ligatures or illustrations. There’s a pretty extensive history of written notation for dance, which in terms of motion is fairly close to fencing, but none besides &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labanotation&#34;&gt;Labanotation&lt;/a&gt; (which is used by the US for the copyright of dance) have significantly caught on and endured in history. Dance/Movement notation is a relatively niche field and jam-packed with advanced symbols and flexible geometry. Without resorting to clunky spoken language, it’s tough to describe a sequence of bodily movements quickly, casually and succinctly in non-graphical form.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Fencing Masks for U.S. Infantry &amp; Cavalry, circa 1919</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometime shortly before January 24, 1919, the A.G. Spalding Brothers Company developed fencing masks for the U.S. Government. Two masks are recorded in the National Archives, one for infantry and one cavalry, a front and side view is presented for each.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Curiously it is the cavalry mask which bears the best resemblance to the modern fencing masks we’re familiar with nowadays. It also offers the best protection, while contrastingly the infantry mask offers better visual fidelity – at expense of eye cover.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
