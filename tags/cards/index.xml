      <description>&lt;p&gt;To play a card game like poker by correspondence would require the decks to be exactly the same sequence in both locations similar to correspondence chess where the boards must be exactly the same states in both locations. (For simplicity I am speaking on the assumption of two players, but for &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; players the rule remains.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However unlike chess where the players can openly see the state of the board, the players in a card game like poker must be unaware of the state of the deck. This makes things trickier, and so both players must perform a shared seeded blind shuffle of their decks, the goal being to have both shuffle their decks fairly but result in the same unknown sequences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
