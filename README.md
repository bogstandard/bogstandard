# ‚õÑÔ∏è Eric, [Bogstandard](https://github.com/bogstandard/)

Greetings, hope you're enjoying the winter ‚õÑÔ∏è

My favourite projects are pinned below but here's a quick rundown on the state of things.

The club is powered by [Lapland Golf Course](https://github.com/bogstandard/lapland-golf-course), a custom Jekyll theme for GitHub Pages that allows anyone to establish their own unique private clubs. This theme can be used for any golfing competitions, not just Advent of Code!

## ‚≠êÔ∏è [Sphere of Influence](http://sphere-of-influence.github.io) is still mapping Soviet Culture!
Though there's been no recent code changes, the map is still self updating & curating the history and civilian life of the USSR. Meanwhile the [Northpole Beta](https://sphere-of-influence.github.io/#!/northpole) ‚ùÑÔ∏è showcases just how dynamic the platform can be. 

A fork of Sphere of Influence is under private development to allow the public to easily create their own maps.

## üåß [RL-Weather](https://github.com/bogstandard/rl-weather) is raining & snowing on players!
With over [~4500 active installs](https://runelite.net/plugin-hub/show/rl-weather) this lightweight Rune Lite plugin provides crunchy old school weather effects to players of OSRS.

## üå≤ [Lapland Golf Club](https://bogstandard.github.io/lapland-golf-club/) is over!
An open scoring system to complement [Eric Wastl's](https://github.com/topaz) annual [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com). Code golf your solutions and track your running average. Lapland Golf Club allows play alongside friends in any language from any repo and self updates (almost) automatically! The club has closed for the season, see you next year!
